\maketitle

The second part of this course covers topics in learning and probabilistic approaches to AI\@.  The problems listed in table~\ref{probs} will act as fodder for the remaining three exams  Some problems will be done in class, others not. You should work them on your own or in groups. You are always welcome to come see me for help on these problems.
